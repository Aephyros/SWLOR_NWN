They are referred to as the galaxy''s most numerous species, due to the fact that they can be born and live on almost all worlds. They have had a hand in the creation of many galactic factions, and are known as one of the oldest species next to the Duros.\n\nHumans are the galaxy''s most numerous and politically dominant sentient species with millions of major and minor colonies galaxy-wide. Believed to have originated on the galactic capital of Coruscant, they can be found anywhere, engaged in many different pursuits: spacers, mercenaries, smugglers, merchants, soldiers, assassins, farmers, crime lords, laborers, slaves, slavers, and many others, including Jedi and Sith.\n\nThe human race has played a key role in the Unification Wars, and it is also responsible for the forming of the Galactic Republic.\n\nSince Humans are the most common sentient species, they are often considered to be a standard or average to which the biology, psychology, and culture of other species are compared.

SET Text = 'Bonuses: +1 INT, +1 WIS\nPenalties: -1 STR, -1 CON\nStarting Languages: Galactic Basic, Cheunh\n\nChiss are blue-skinned humanoids from the planet Csilla in the Unknown Regions.\n\nThe Chiss are a proud and highly intelligent species, valuing a knack for strategy and subterfuge over brute force. Although isolated in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy within their so-called “Chiss Ascendency,” the Chiss were singled out by the Empire as potential servants and allies because of their outsider status and their relative lack of moral qualms. \n\nIt is not that Chiss are by nature evil, but that they value pragmatism and efficiency and recognize both those qualities reflected in the Empire. While as a nonhuman, non-Sith species, Chiss are regarded as second-class citizens within the Empire, the Chiss Ascendancy is permitted self-vernance and supporters of a more diverse Empire often use the Chiss as an example of what the Empire can accomplish by welcoming other species. A few rare Chiss have even achieved official rank in the Imperial military and Imperial Intelligence.'

Most Zabrak wear ritual facial tattoos, which vary from simple lines to more elaborate patterns. The designs can mark significant events in their lives, or merely be a matter of personal preference. After discovering space travel early in their civilization, they quickly colonized worlds throughout the Mid Rim and gained a reputation as pioneers and explorers.\n\nZabrak are also skilled warriors, engaging in inter-clan competitions to hone their talents; their physiology, which includes a secondary heart and some resistance to pain, gives them surprising endurance in battle.'

SET Text = 'Bonuses: +1 CON, +1 CHA\nPenalties: -1 STR, -1 INT\nStarting Languages: Galactic Basic, Twi''leki\n\nTwi’leks are a humanoid species with long, prehensile head-tails called lekku–organs housing sections of the Twi’lek brain and specialized for communication through subtle motion. \n\nTwi’leks are native to the harsh world of Ryloth, a planet that has suffered from occupation by the Hutt Cartel in recent years; Twi’leks on Ryloth not forced to work in the mines are often taken as slaves, exported to markets throughout the Outer Rim. Millennia of dispersion into the wider galaxy, however, means that many Twi’leks have little or no sense of connection with their beleaguered homeworld; Twi’leks may be second only to humans in their ubiquity throughout known space. \n\nNonetheless, many Twi’leks can’t escape the shadows of slavery and the underworld–often, they find work with the same pirates, slavers and spice dealers who have traditionally oppressed their species. Twi’lek names vary dramatically, depending on whether the parents follow the old Twi’lek tradition of combining given and family name, or use the more common approach (separating first name and surname) used by many other species. Some Twi’leks eschew any surname altogether'

It was the Cathar reputation for martial prowess that drew the Mandalorians to besiege their homeworld several centuries a. Despite their valiant resistance against the remorseless invaders, the native Cathar were virtually exterminated. \n\nOut of millions, only a few hundred escaped the Mandalorians’ attack and fled to Republic space. In the time since their near-extinction, the Cathar have rebuilt their numbers to become common faces on Republic worlds. The Jedi Order, Galactic Senate and Republic military all claim numerous proud and loyal Cathar among their ranks. It is rare to encounter a Cathar who doesn’t actively despise the Sith Empire–and especially its Mandalorian allies.'
